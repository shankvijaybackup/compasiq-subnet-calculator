   - Description: `Professional IPv4 subnet calculator with visual subnetting - React + Vite + Tailwind`
   - Public or Private: Choose your preference
   - ❌ Don't initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

2. **Push your code** (replace YOUR_USERNAME):

```bash
cd "/Users/vijayshankar/Downloads/Fun Projects/SubnetLator"

git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/compasiq-subnet-calculator.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Option 3: Use Existing CompasIQ Repo
